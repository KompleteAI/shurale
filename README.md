**Shurale** is a dialogue model perfect for engaging in realistic and wide-reaching discussions.
The model's strength comes from its 7-billion parameter foundation (based on **Llama 2**), which was meticulously *
*trained on over a million dialogues**, with clear roles defined for dialogue participants.
Unique in its approach, it uses **narrative context**, aiding in the creation and maintenance of coherent characters
throughout a conversation.
This results in communications that are seamless, lively, and strikingly natural. A pleasant detail: the entire training
process only **cost $100**.

> Shurale [/ É är…ëÀàl ≤e/] is a forest spirit in Bashkir and Tatar mythology.

# ü§î Why not ChatGPT?

ChatGPT, even GPT4, struggles with producing human-like dialogues.
A lot of modifications and tricks are necessary just to receive a basic human-like response to a simple query such as "
how are you?".
Responses from GPT models and other instructional models often lack authenticity and feel awkward.
These instructional models thrive in a wholly different sphere related to rational processes and information retrieval,
offering limited control and training opportunities.

**Bottom line** - trying to chat with GPT like it's a human will likely lead to a slew of problems.
**Shurale**, however, tackles this issue effectively.
It steers clear of these hurdles by permitting more human-like dialogues and providing provisions to create a distinct
character.

---

# üìù Prompt

The parts of the dialogue (narrative and replies) are separated using a newline symbol: **\n**

The **maximum length** during training is **2048 tokens**.

The [SODA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/soda) dataset was used for the training process.

## Format

Training examples consisted of both the narrative and the dialogue itself, with the participants' names clearly
indicated.

<table>
<tr>
<td>
Narrative
</td>
<td>
A description of the situation within the dialogue
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Characters names
</td>
<td>
A list of names of the characters participating in the dialogue
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>
Phrases
</td>
<td>
Phrases used by the participants in the dialogue
</td>
</tr>
</table>

Narratives were deliberately omitted from 5% of the training examples, allowing the model to maintain a dialogue even
without a narrative. However, using the model without a narrative is generally not recommended.

## Example

### Training sample

The baton was passed to Garry who then became the boss. He ran the show with an iron fist, making sure that everything
was done his way. No one dared to cross him for fear of being on the receiving end of his wrath
Garry: What the hell is going on around here? I thought I told you to get this place in order!
Bob: I'm sorry, boss. We've been having some trouble with the employees lately. They just don't seem to be following
orders like they used to.
Garry: Well, you need to get them in line or I'll find someone who will! This place is a mess and it's all your fault!
Bob: Yes, boss. I'll take care of it right away.

### Real world example

The baton was passed to Garry who then became the boss. He ran the show with an iron fist, making sure that everything
was done his way. No one dared to cross him for fear of being on the receiving end of his wrath
Garry: What the hell is going on around here? I thought I told you to get this place in order!
Bob:

In this example, we explicitly tell the model that it's now Bob's turn to speak. The end of the reply can be designated
either by a newline symbol or by the name of the first character followed by a colon (**Garry:**).

# üîß How to use

## Transformers

1. Load the model

```python
from transformers import AutoTokenizer, AutoModelForCausalLM

tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("KompleteAI/ShuraleBase")
model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("KompleteAI/ShuraleBase")
```

2. Run generation

```python
input_text = "Dialog between two colleagues: Emma and Anna.\nEmma:"

tokenized = tokenizer(
  input_text,
  return_tensors="pt"
).to("cuda:0")

generated_indices = model.generate(
  **tokenized,
  do_sample=True,
  max_new_tokens=128,
  repetition_penalty=1.1,  # llama2 is prone to repetitions
  top_p=0.9
)[0].cpu()

print(tokenizer.decode(generated_indices))
```

## Text Generation Inference

Run model as a service using HuggingFace ü§ó inference server:

## Dataset

The model was trained using only the training part of the [SODA](https://huggingface.co/datasets/allenai/soda) dataset.

## Results

This model, based on llama2-7b, was trained on over 1.1 million dialogues using 4 RTX 4090 (24 Gb) GPUs. The training
process lasted 45 hours and made use of advanced techniques such as QLoRA (int4), DeepSpeed Stage 2, Flash Attention 2,
and gradient checkpointing.

# üìÅ License Details

Please note that Llama 2 has its own
license ([link](https://ai.meta.com/resources/models-and-libraries/llama-downloads/)), and the SODA dataset has its own
license as well ([link](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)). The responsibility for using this model remains
with you.

---

# üîê Limitations

The model was trained on a synthetic dataset generated using ChatGPT, leading to a few critical issues with the current
version. Often, the model tends to be rather bland and can occasionally be unnatural. Although the model wasn't
explicitly trained to be safe, it's likely these traits are inherited from ChatGPT. Moreover, handling very long
dialogues is considered out-of-domain for the model since it was trained with a maximum length of 2048 tokens. The
model's ability to generate truth-valid facts wasn't tested, but it's probable that its performance in this area lags
behind OpenAI models. Also, this model wasn't explicitly trained to follow instructions.

---

# üïπ Use cases

It is suggested to set a maximum context length, for example, 10 messages. Then, store the context in some form of data
storage, such as a database. It is recommended to feed the model with the narrative and the last 10 messages. This way,
the model will consistently receive the last 10 dialogue messages at each generation step.

```python
def generate(prompt: str) -> str:
  ...


max_context_length = 10

narrative = "..."

separator = "\n"

bot_prompt = "Bot"
user_prompt = "Person"

context = list()

while True:
  user_phrase = input("You: ")
  context.append(f"{user_prompt}: {user_phrase}")
  model_prompt = separator.join(
    [narrative] + context[-max_context_length:] + [f"{bot_prompt}:"]
  )
  generated_response = generate(model_prompt)
  bot_phrase = f"{bot_prompt}: {generated_response}"
  context.append(bot_phrase)
  print(bot_phrase)
```

<summary>Example #5</summary>

**Narrative:**
Simran is a strong and independent woman. She quit her job at Myriah's nightclub because she didn't want to be
associated with that type of business anymore. She wants to focus on her own goals and bettering herself.

**Context:**
Simran: I'm done working at your club, Myriah.
Myriah: What? Why? You're one of my best workers.
Simran: I don't want to be associated with that type of business anymore. It's not what I'm about.
Myriah:

**Original response:**
Fine. If that's how you feel, then I won't force you to stay. But I hope you'll reconsider. We could really use someone
like you at the club.

# üõ∞ Future work

If this model proves successful, I plan to implement an algorithm similar to DeepMind's
ReST ([link](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08998.pdf)). The mentioned work has great potential but has a number of
shortcomings, which I've managed to address in my approach.
